## Overview

My first challenge with javascript in frontendmentor. The JavaScript part is pretty straightforward. I'm still learning most of JavaScript before I move and learn React. Anyways, this was a fun Project.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
